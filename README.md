# RUFS - Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge Mod
 
## Description
    A mod that contains a bunch of random features I felt like adding.
    Most of them are vary experimental and may not work as intended.
    It is likely if you change some values too much your game may become 
    unstable unusable, if this happens, deleting the config file 
    `rufs.toml` in `.minecraft\config\` or values within it should fix
    this issue after a restart.

## Config
     Open the config by either running /rufs in chat or click the button in
     the options menu labeled 'RUFS Config' next to the 'Chat Settings' button.
## Features

   - Block Face Render
